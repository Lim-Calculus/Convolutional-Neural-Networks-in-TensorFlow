My solutions to Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow (DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate))
## Week 1 - Exploring a Larger Dataset
<br> In the first course in this specialization, you had an introduction to TensorFlow, and how, with its high level APIs you could do basic image classification, and you learned a little bit about Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). In this course you'll go deeper into using ConvNets will real-world data, and learn about techniques that you can use to improve your ConvNet performance, particularly when doing image classification!In Week 1, this week, you'll get started by looking at a much larger dataset than you've been using thus far: The Cats and Dogs dataset which had been a Kaggle Challenge in image classification! </br>
